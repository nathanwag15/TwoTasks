Requirements specification
-Two users will input coordinates and a radius size for two circles.
-The program will calculate the distance between the two circles and determine if they overlap at all.
-The program will tell the users if they are in each other's circle.

System Analysis
-The system will gain the values from the user
-The system will determine the distance between the points.
-The system will calculate if the circles intersect.
-The system will print out the results.

System Design
-The system will use this formula to determine the distance between the two points.
equation1 = math.pow(x2 - x1, 2)
equation2 = math.pow(y2 - y1, 2)
distance = math.sqrt(equation1 + equation2)
The program will also determine if the circle's intersect by subtracting the radii

Testing

test 1

Welcome to the Social Situation Analyzer System
Person One
    Enter your name: Alice
    Enter your position (x, y): 50, -70
    Enter your personal space radius: 30

Person Two
    Enter your name: Bob
    Enter your position (x, y): 30, -50
    Enter your personal space radius: 20

Social Situation Analysis Results
    Person Test: Bob is in Alice's personal space
    Space Test: Alice and Bob's personal spaces overlap


test 2

Welcome to the Social Situation Analyzer System
Person One
        Enter your name: Nate
        Enter your position (x y): 12 -30
        Enter your personal space radius: 20
Person Two
        Enter your name: Steve
        Enter your position (x y): -12 30
        Enter your personal space radius: 20
Social Situation Analysis Results
   Person Test:  Neither Nate or Steve is in the other's personal space.
   Space Test:  Nate and Steve's personal spaces do not overlap.
